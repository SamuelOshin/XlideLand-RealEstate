## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### Backend Endpoints:
```
POST /api/accounts/register/           # Public: buyer/seller registration
POST /api/accounts/admin/register/    # Admin: create any role including admin
POST /api/accounts/login/             # Public: authentication
GET  /api/accounts/profile/           # Auth: basic user data

```

### Security Features:

- CORS configuration for frontend

### Data Flow:
1. User registers → UserProfile created with selected role
2. User logs in → JWT tokens issued
3. Frontend fetches → User data + Profile data with role
4. AuthContext provides → Accurate role for component access control
5. API requests include → Authorization header with JWT token

### 3. **Role Expansion**
- [ ] Sub-roles (e.g., "Premium Agent", "Property Manager")
- [ ] Permission granularity (specific feature access)
- [ ] Team/organization management
- [ ] Custom role creation
