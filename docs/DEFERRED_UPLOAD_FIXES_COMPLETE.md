# Deferred Upload and Authentication Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. UX Issue: Immediate Upload vs. Deferred Upload
**Problem**: The file upload component was uploading files immediately when selected, not when the form was submitted.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced `FileUpload` component with `FileUploadDeferred` component in the property creation form
- Updated form state management to handle selected files vs. uploaded files
- Modified form submission to handle file uploads during form submission

### 2. Authentication Issue: 401 Errors on Upload
**Problem**: Upload API routes were returning 401 errors due to authentication token issues.

**Solution**:
- Fixed authentication token handling in the API route
- Added proper token verification with Django backend
- Updated token passing from frontend to backend
- Added better error messages for debugging

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Property Creation Form (`/frontend/src/app/dashboard/properties/new/page.tsx`)
- **Import Change**: Replaced `FileUpload` with `FileUploadDeferred`
- **State Management**: Added `selectedImages` state to track selected files
- **Handlers**: 
  - `handleImagesSelected`: Manages selected files
  - `handleImageRemoved`: Removes selected files
  - `handleSubmit`: Updated to upload files only on form submission
- **Authentication**: Added JWT token to upload requests
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and user feedback

#### 2. FileUploadDeferred Component (`/frontend/src/components/ui/FileUploadDeferred.tsx`)
- Already existed and properly configured for deferred uploads
- Shows selected files with "Ready to upload" status
- Only uploads when explicitly triggered

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Upload API Route (`/frontend/src/app/api/upload/property-images/route.ts`)
- **Authentication**: Fixed token verification with Django backend
- **Error Handling**: Added detailed error messages
- **Token Management**: Proper token extraction and validation
- **Django Integration**: Fixed metadata storage to Django backend

## How It Works Now

### 1. File Selection (No Upload)
```typescript
// User selects files through FileUploadDeferred
const handleImagesSelected = (files: File[]) => {
  setSelectedImages(prev => [...prev, ...files]);
};
```

### 2. Form Submission (Upload Triggered)
```typescript
// Upload only happens when form is submitted
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  if (selectedImages.length > 0) {
    const formData = new FormData();
    selectedImages.forEach(file => formData.append('file', file));
    
    // Include JWT token for authentication
    const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
    const response = await fetch('/api/upload/property-images', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` },
      body: formData,
    });
    
    // Handle upload results
  }
};
```

### 3. Authentication Flow
```typescript
// API route verifies token with Django backend
async function getAuthenticatedUser(request: NextRequest) {
  const token = request.headers.get('authorization')?.substring(7);
  
  const response = await fetch(`${apiUrl}/accounts/profile/`, {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
  });
  
  return response.ok ? await response.json() : null;
}
```

## Testing

### Prerequisites
1. Django backend running on `http://localhost:8000`
2. Next.js frontend running on `http://localhost:3001`
3. User logged in with valid JWT token

### Test Steps
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/properties/new`
2. Fill out property form
3. Select images using file upload component
4. Verify files show as "Ready to upload"
5. Submit form
6. Verify files are uploaded and property is created

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Files are selected but not uploaded immediately
- ✅ Files show "Ready to upload" status
- ✅ Upload only happens on form submission
- ✅ No 401 authentication errors
- ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users can select files and review them before uploading
2. **Atomic Operations**: Files upload as part of form submission
3. **Error Recovery**: Failed uploads don't lose form data
4. **Authentication**: Proper token-based authentication
5. **Feedback**: Clear status messages for users

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/app/dashboard/properties/new/page.tsx` - Property creation form
- `frontend/src/app/api/upload/property-images/route.ts` - Upload API route
- `test_deferred_upload.py` - Test script for verification

## Next Steps

1. Test the complete flow in the UI
2. Add similar deferred upload to document upload forms
3. Add progress indicators for large file uploads
4. Implement file upload cancellation
5. Add image preview functionality
